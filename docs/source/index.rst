AutoMapper
==========

A convention-based object-object mapper.

AutoMapper uses a fluent configuration API to define an object-object
mapping strategy. AutoMapper uses a convention-based matching algorithm
to match up source to destination values. AutoMapper is geared towards
model projection scenarios to flatten complex object models to DTOs and
other simple objects, whose design is better suited for serialization,
communication, messaging, or simply an anti-corruption layer between the
domain and application layer.
