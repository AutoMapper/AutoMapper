<!-- 

   If you're new to AutoMapper, please ask a question on StackOverflow first and come back here if the people there consider it a bug.
   If you've just upgraded to 11.0, please read the upgrade guide first (https://docs.automapper.org/en/latest/11.0-Upgrade-Guide.html).
   Try the [MyGet](https://docs.automapper.org/en/latest/The-MyGet-build.html) build.
   Try to provide [a minimal, complete, and verifiable example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve), preferably a [gist](https://gist.github.com/lbargaoanu/9c7233441c3a3413cc2b9b9ebb5964a9) that we can execute and see fail. [Here](https://gist.github.com/lbargaoanu/0cbc531306223f7ffc5468becf2642d6) is an example for ProjectTo.
   For feature requests, just clear out the below.
