What is AutoMapper?
--------------------------------
AutoMapper is a simple little library built to solve a deceptively complex problem - getting rid of code that mapped one object to another. This type of code is rather dreary and boring to write, so why not invent a tool to do it for us?

How do I get started?
--------------------------------
Check out the [getting started guide](https://github.com/AutoMapper/AutoMapper/wiki/Getting-started). When you're done there, the [wiki](https://github.com/AutoMapper/AutoMapper/wiki) goes in to the nitty-gritty details. Finally, check out the [dnrTV episode](http://www.dnrtv.com/default.aspx?showNum=155) for a full walkthrough. If you have questions, you can post them to the [Mailing List](http://groups.google.com/group/automapper-users).

Where can I get it?
--------------------------------
First, [install NuGet](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/start-here/installing-nuget). Then, install [AutoMapper](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AutoMapper/) from the package manager console:

    PM> Install-Package AutoMapper
